### Hi there,ðŸ‘‹ I am Yuvraj Manoo

After completing a technicians diploma in Software Engineering, I have learnt a lot about HTML, CSS, SQL and object oriented Java programming. I am currently searching for a job as a software developer and I am always willing to expand on the knowledge and skills that I have already developed.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about front-end and back-end web development so that I may get a job as a software developer in the near future.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have always preferred to build algorithmic functions than to arrange elements on a webpage.
